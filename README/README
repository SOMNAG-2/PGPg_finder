### PGPg Finder ###
PGPg Finder is a command-line tool that offers different workflows for genome and metagenome annotation of Plant-Growth Promotion Genes. It's designed to be flexible and easy to use without a necessity to install databases, with several pre-configured workflows to choose from based on the tools and steps you need.

Features
The pipeline allows you to choose from several workflows based on the tools and steps you need. The workflows currently available are:

genomeKO_wf: A genome annotation pipeline that uses hmmsearch and KEGG profiles.
genomePROKKA_wf: A genome annotation with PROKKA.

metafast_KO_wf: A metagenome workflow with megahit assembly, Bowtie2 mapping, samtools quantification, and annotation with hmmsearch and KEGG profiles.
meta_PROKKA_wf: A metagenome workflow with megahit assembly, Bowtie2 mapping, samtools quantification, and PROKKA annotation.


Each workflow is designed to be run with a specific set of input files and produces a set of output files. The tool also supports running on multiple threads to improve performance.

Installation:

To use the tool, you first need to clone the repository and ensure that all dependencies are installed.

git clone github_repository_url

After this procedure, you need to performe the installation of dependancies with conda (recomended).
The conda will create a separated environment called PGPb_finder.

bash install.sh

If conda not work for you, you can install the dependences mannualy without an separeted environment and run PGPb_finder (not recomended).

Usage:

Then, you can run the tool using the following command:

python PGPb_finder.py -w workflow -i input_directory -o output_directory -t threads -a assembly_file (optional)


1) Running PGPb_finder with genomes:

a) PROKKA annotation:

python PGPb_finder.py -w genomePROKKA_wf -i /path/to/fasta/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12

b) KO annotation:

python PGPb_finder.py -w genomeKO_wf -i /path/to/fasta/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12


2) Running PGPb_finder with metagenomes:
 
a) PROKKA annotation 

python PGPb_finder.py -w meta_PROKKA_wf -i /path/to/fasta/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12

b) KO annotation 

python PGPb_finder.py -w meta_fast_wf -i /path/to/fasta/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12


For help with the arguments, you can use the command python PGPb_finder -h.

Dependencies
This tool depends on the following libraries and tools:

Python 3
Bash
Prodigal
HMMER
Megahit
Bowtie2
Salmon
BBmap
PROKKA

Moreover, this pipeline was created with a curated database called "PLant-associated BActeria web resource (PLaBAse)".
We encourage you to cite the PLaBAse:
