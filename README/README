### PGPg Finder ###
PGPg Finder is a command-line tool that offers different workflows for genome and metagenome annotation of Plant-Growth Promotion Genes. It's designed to be flexible and easy to use without a necessity to install databases, with several pre-configured workflows to choose from based on the tools and steps you need.

Features
The pipeline allows you to choose from several workflows based on the tools and steps you need. The workflows currently available are:

genome_wf - Genome annotation with diamond against PGPT-db database of PLaBAse.
metafast_wf - Fast metagenome direct read annotation with diamond against mgPGPT-db database of PLaBAse.
meta_wf - Metagenome assembly annotation (diamond) and coverage (Bowtie2, samtools bedtools) with mgPGPT-db database of PLaBAse.

Each workflow is designed to be run with a specific set of input files and produces a set of output files. The tool also supports running on multiple threads to improve performance.

Installation:

To use the tool, you first need to clone the repository and ensure that all dependencies are installed.

git clone https://github.com/tpellegrinetti/PGPg_finder

After this procedure, you need to performe the installation of dependancies with conda (recomended).
The conda will create a separated environment called PGPg_finder.

bash install.sh

If conda not work for you, you can install the dependences mannualy without an separeted environment and run PGPb_finder (not recomended).

Usage:

Then, you can run the tool using the following command:

python PGPb_finder.py -w workflow -i input_directory -o output_directory -t threads -a assembly_file (optional)


1) Running PGPg_finder with genomes:

python PGPg_finder.py -w genome_wf -i /path/to/fasta/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t {number_of_threads}

2) Running PGPg_finder with metagenomes:
 
a) Fast way 

python PGPg_finder.py -w metafast_wf -i /path/to/fastq/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t {number_of_threads}

b) Slow way (but more precise) 

python PGPg_finder.py -w meta_wf -i /path/to/fastq/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t {number_of_threads}


For help with the arguments, you can use the command python PGPb_finder -h.

Dependencies
This tool depends on the following libraries and tools:

Python 3
Bash
Prodigal
HMMER
Megahit
Bowtie2
Salmon
BBmap
PROKKA

Moreover, this pipeline was created with a curated database called "PLant-associated BActeria web resource (PLaBAse)" https://plabase.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/pb/plabase.php.
We encourage you to cite the PLaBAse:
