# PGPg_finder
PGPg Finder is a command-line tool that offers different workflows for genome and metagenome annotation of Plant-Growth Promotion Genes. It's designed to be flexible and easy to use without a necessity to install databases, with several pre-configured workflows to choose from based on the tools and steps you need.


# Features
The pipeline allows you to choose from several workflows based on the tools and steps you need. The workflows currently available are:

## Genome Analysis
genome_wf: A genome annotation pipeline that uses hmmsearch and KEGG profiles.

## Metagenome Analysis
metafastwf: A metagenome workflow with megahit assembly, Bowtie2 mapping, samtools quantification, and annotation with hmmsearch and KEGG profiles.
meta_wf: A metagenome workflow with megahit assembly, Bowtie2 mapping, samtools quantification, and PROKKA annotation.


Each workflow is designed to be run with a specific set of input files and produces a set of output files. The tool also supports running on multiple threads to improve performance.


# Installation:

To use the tool, you first need to clone the repository and ensure that all dependencies are installed.

git clone https://github.com/tpellegrinetti/PGPg_finder/

After this procedure, you need to performe the installation of dependancies with conda (recomended).
The conda will create a separated environment called PGPb_finder.

`bash install.sh`

If conda not work for you, you can install the dependences mannualy without a separeted environment and run PGPb_finder (not recomended).

# Usage:

You can run the PGPg_finder tool using the following command:

`python PGPb_finder.py -w workflow -i input_directory -o output_directory -t threads`

the -a argument is optional and works if you want to provide assembly files


1) Running PGPb_finder with genomes:

`python PGPb_finder.py -w genome_wf -i /path/to/fasta/folder/ -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12`


2) Running PGPb_finder with metagenomes:
 
a) Fast way (less accurated)

`python PGPb_finder.py -w metafast_wf -i /path/to/fasta/folder -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12`

b) Slow way (more accurated) 

`python PGPb_finder.py -w meta_wf -i /path/to/fasta/folder -o /path/to/your/desired/out/ -t 12`

Here you can provide your metagenome assemblies with -a option

### For help with the arguments, you can use the command python PGPb_finder -h. ###
